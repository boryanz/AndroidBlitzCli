Before copying to the new package structure:
- generate all package structures needed from the config in the old path.

After:
1. create a new package structure using package name from config.
2. get old path from last package in default package name.
3. create a new path for last package name from the config.
4. iterate over all directories recursively and copy dir from old path to the new one.
